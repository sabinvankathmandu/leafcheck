# ✍️ Project Description

## 🌿 LeafCheck – Your Pocket Doctor for Plants

**LeafCheck** is an AI-powered plant health diagnostic tool designed to make smart agriculture accessible anytime, anywhere. By combining artificial intelligence with computer vision, LeafCheck empowers users to detect plant diseases early — just by taking or uploading a photo of a leaf.

Each year, plant diseases cause billions in crop losses, especially in rural or underserved areas where expert support is scarce. LeafCheck bridges this gap by delivering rapid, on-the-spot diagnostics. In seconds, the tool determines whether a plant is healthy or infected. If a disease is detected, LeafCheck provides vital information, recommended remedies, and preventative tips — all in one click.

This solution serves a wide range of users:

* Farmers and gardeners seeking early intervention
* Researchers and AgriTech startups exploring scalable solutions
* Government bodies and NGOs focused on sustainable agriculture
* Students, mentors, and developers contributing to innovation in agri-AI

At its core, LeafCheck aims to plant the seed of smart, inclusive agriculture — one leaf at a time.
